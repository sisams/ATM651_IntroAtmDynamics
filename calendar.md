| Unit 1 | Monday  | Wednesday  |
|---|------------- | ------------- |
| First week| Intro/welcome | Math review  |
| 2| Assign HW0; review SI units & physics basics | Go over any [HW0](https://github.com/ATMOcanes/ATM651_IntroAtmDynamics/tree/master/Unit1-Terminology_and_Tools) questions; survey Wallace-Hobbs Ch1 Q & A |
| 3 | LABOR DAY- NO CLASS | Any last HW0 questions? Collect it. Intro to [Ju-Py-Github](https://github.com/MPOcanes/MPO624-2020/blob/master/presentations/ProfGrumpy_guide_condaJuPyGitHub.pptx.pdf), installation assignment|
| 4 | Tsai - return HW0, discuss. Computer install clinic; Jupyter demo & first .ipynb assignment (kinematics) | **Reviewed student kinematic .ipynb's**, began on WH Ch7. Showed using Stokes' theorem (7.3) that tangential wind falls off as 1/distance from an isolated circular patch of vorticity. |
| 5 |Cover the assigned **reading through 7.2.6**, & review **students answers to 7.5 a-k**. Collect (midnight) **HW1 ASSIGNMENT: Show (7.2) for a circular area using (7.4), and do problems 7.6-7.10**. Hand out draft sketch for Unit 1 exam. | Vorticity. Cover the assigned **reading: section 7.2.9.** & review **students' prepared, time-stamped questions (1 per student)** on vorticity films [(parts 1&2) here](http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html). Assign vortex-interactions lab (IDV views captured in .ipynb). |
| 6 | ***Unit 1 in-class exam: vocabulary, math tools, kinematics*** | Decomposition of wind fields. Geostrophic/ageo, irrotational/divergent; the different kinds of ageostrophic flow |
| 7 | Discuss **graded work so far**. Then discuss assigned **reading: section 7.2.7 (thermal wind; i.e., all material through 7.2.9)**, and **any HW2 questions**; and **elicit student answers (or questions) to 7.5 l-z**  | Collect (midnight) **HW2: Force-balanced wind problems 7.19, 7.21, 7.22, 7.24, 7.42; Thermal wind problems 7.5m, 7.11, 7.25, 7.26** |
